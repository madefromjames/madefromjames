### I'm constantly working on myself

</div>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Django project - *Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”*
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and diving deeper into `JavaScript` and more
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on `Python | Django, Flask, Fast-API` - and for any other tool you might be using, I’m keen to learn and adapt.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
    - **Open Source Contribution:** Finding beginner-friendly open source projects needing documentation or coding help.
    - **Career Guidance:** Connecting with industry professionals who can offer insights into the tech job market and career planning.
